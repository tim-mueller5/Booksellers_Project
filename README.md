# Phase 4 Full-Stack Application Project - Bookseller

## Introduction
This app was created by Ralph Shui and Timothy Mueller

## Setup

### `server/`

The `server/` directory contains all of the backend code.

`app.py` is your Flask application. 

To download the dependencies for the backend server, run:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by
running:

```console
python server/app.py
```

Check that your server serves the default route `http://localhost:5555`. You
should see a web page with the heading "Phase 4 Project Server".

### `client/`

The `client/` directory contains all of your frontend code. The file
`package.json` has been configured with the `proxy` field to forward
requests to `"http://localhost:5555".

To download the dependencies for the frontend client, run:

```console
npm install --prefix client
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```

Check that your the React client displays a default page
`http://localhost:3000`. You should see a web page with the heading "Phase 4
Project Client".

## Generating Your Database

Edit `models.py` and start creating your models. Import your models as needed in
other modules, i.e. `from models import ...`.

Remember to regularly run
`flask db revision --autogenerate -m'<descriptive message>'`, replacing
`<descriptive message>` with an appropriate message, and `flask db upgrade head`
to track your modifications to the database and create checkpoints in case you
ever need to roll those modifications back.


If you want to seed your database, now would be a great time to write out your
`seed.py` script and run it to generate some test data. Faker has been included
in the Pipfile if you'd like to use that library.

#### `config.py`

When developing a large Python application, you might run into a common issue:
_circular imports_. A circular import occurs when two modules import from one
another, such as `app.py` and `models.py`. When you create a circular import and
attempt to run your app, you'll see the following error:

```console
ImportError: cannot import name
```

If you're going to need an object in multiple modules like `app` or `db`,
creating a _third_ module to instantiate these objects can save you a great deal
of circular grief. Here's a good start to a Flask config file (you may need more
if you intend to include features like authentication and passwords):

```py
# Standard library imports

# Remote library imports
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from flask_restful import Api
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy import MetaData

# Local imports

# Instantiate app, set attributes
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.json.compact = False

# Define metadata, instantiate db
metadata = MetaData(naming_convention={
    "fk": "fk_%(table_name)s_%(column_0_name)s_%(referred_table_name)s",
})
db = SQLAlchemy(metadata=metadata)
migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

# Instantiate REST API
api = Api(app)

# Instantiate CORS
CORS(app)

```

Now let's review that last line...

#### CORS

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system that uses HTTP headers to
determine whether resources from different servers-of-origin can be accessed. If
you're using the fetch API to connect your frontend to your Flask backend, you
need to configure CORS on your Flask application instance. Lucky for us, that
only takes one line:

```py
CORS(app)

```

By default, Flask-CORS enables CORS on all routes in your application with all
fetching servers. You can also specify the resources that allow CORS. The
following specifies that routes beginning with `api/` allow CORS from any
originating server:

```py
CORS(app, resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": "*"}})

```

You can also set this up resource-by-resource by importing and using the
`@cross_origin` decorator:

```py
@app.route("/")
@cross_origin()
def howdy():
  return "Howdy partner!"

```
